    "Today's lesson is designed as an introduction to more advanced libraries or techniques in the realm of Natural Language Processing. These techniques can help you gain even greater accuracy in your modeling, but require more in-depth knowledge of new libraries, new techniques, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we'll be introducing a lot of new material today, we'll be doing our best to limit the discussion to what is most immediately helpful. Each of these libraries and techniques has much more going on than we have time to discuss this week and we encourage you to spend time investigating and understanding these libraries. However, **mastery of these libraries, techniques, and materials introduced today is not required nor expected.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For Project 4 and your Capstone Project, if you are pursuing an NLP approach, these libraries may be very helpful. However, you can get a lot of mileage out of refining and using the sklearn libraries that we discussed yesterday. A good workflow is to try simple answers first and move into more advanced techniques as your use-case requires -- your goals as modelers should be to make best choice that you can, contingent on time and use-case. Having something work, but not be 100% correct is better than having something 100% correct that doesn't work yet. "

During a larger project, we will likely spend days if not weeks on feature extraction and analysis and will want to make as many useful features as possible to make as good a model as possible. Other techniques may involve more nuanced modeling, such as looking at the sequence of parts of speech, etc. Part of this lesson is designed to expose to what is out there so that when faced with a situation where those techniques may be useful, you're aware of their existence."

    "## Assigning documents to topics using LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is an unstructured machine learning technique that iteratively attempts to find clusters of words that are likely to happen together across multiple documents. We interpret the co-occurance of these words together to be analgous to different topics discussed in across a body of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "LDA works by iteratively guessing how likely a given word is to be part of a given topic until we tell it to stop. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of updating probabilities will make more sense after next weeks lectures on Bayes, but we'll quickly discuss here and move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Explanation cribbed from [Introduction to Latent Dirichlet Allocation](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/))\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by picking a set of documents and a number of topics that we want to generate. One way that we do this is what's known as collapsed Gibbs saampling. We do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly assign every word in every document to one of the $k$ topics:\n",
    "    - $w$: a word in a document\n",
    "    - $d$: a document\n",
    "    - $k$: a topic\n",
    "2. At this point, every word has a likelihood that they belong in a given a topic, based on the other words in documents that they exist in. \n",
    "3. Iterate through every word in every document and:\n",
    "    1. Assume that every other word has the correct likelihood that they belong to each topic (so, `apple` might have a distribution of `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2]` for five topics.\n",
    "    2. Look at the likelihood of seeing word $w$ in document $d$ and adjust the topic probabilities as needed\n",
    "    > for example, if there are a lot of words in topic 1 in document $d$ and word $w$ has a stronger likelihood of being in topic 2, because we're assuming that every **other** distribution is correct, we should change our understanding of where word $w$ belongs and tweak it more in favor of belonging to topic 1, not topic 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can kind of interpret this with an analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine you move to a new town and you don't know what sort of people you want to hang out with. You imagine there's five different groups of people. You start visiting different places around town (the park, the library, the mall, etc.) and noting who's there. Everytime you go to a place you start adjusting your expectation on who you'll see there (such as the goths constantly are at the mall, so we should expect less and less that they'll show up at the library). This is (very roughly) analgous to what LDA is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name latent dirichlet allocation should begin to make more sense in this context:\n",
    "- latent -- because we have no explicit marker of topic and are grouping things together based on features we are inferring, not seeing\n",
    "- [dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) -- is a type of probability distribution for multiple vectors at once (like a bunch of words towards a bunch of topics)\n",
